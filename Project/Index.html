    <h2>What's a Computer?</h2>
    <p>a computer is a device that accepts information (in the form of digitalized data)
         and manipulates it for some result based on a program, software, or sequence of instructions on
          how the data is to be processed.

       <h2>Types Of Computers:</h2>

    <h2>Super Computers</h2>
     <p>supercomputers are designed such that they can process a huge amount of data, like processing trillions of instructions or data just in a second.
         This is because of the thousands of interconnected processors in supercomputers. 
         It is basically used in scientific and engineering applications such as weather forecasting, scientific simulations, and nuclear energy research.</p><br><br>

     <br><h2>Workstation Computers</h2>
     <p>workstation is designed for technical or scientific applications. 
        It consists of a fast microprocessor, with a large amount of RAM and high speed graphic adapter.
         It is a single-user computer. 
         It generally used to perform a specific task with great accuracy.</p><br>

    <br><h2>Mainframe Computers</h2>
    <p>mainframe computers are designed in such a way that it can support hundreds or thousands of users at the same time.
         It also supports multiple programs simultaneously. So, they can execute different processes simultaneously. </p><br><br>
